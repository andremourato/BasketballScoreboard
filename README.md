# Basketball Scoreboard using an FPGA
---
This project consists in a basketball scoreboard displayed to a VGA monitor and controlled by an infrared remote controller using an FPGA.

## Required Material
- FPGA Altera Cyclone IV EP4CE115F29C7
- VGA monitor
- Infrared Remote Controller

## Running the program
Load the file LSDig-ProjFinal-P11-84745_84760.sof into the FPGA

## Interface
The following image shows the interface of the scoreboard. In red we have the time left to the end of the period, in yellow the scores of both teams and in green the number of fouls of each team.
